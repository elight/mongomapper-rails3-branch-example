Put this on Github as the "rails3" branch (https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/tree/rails3) changes how MongoMapper's connection is provisioned.  Didn't see this anywhere after doing some google searching.  Maybe someone else will get some mileage out of this.

For the salient details, see https://github.com/elight/mongomapper-rails3-branch-example/blob/master/config/initializers/mongo.rb
